## Background

​
This is a simple site that allows you add, remove, search through, and delete tasks in your browser. Its saves the tasks to local storage so you are able to refresh your browser and your tasks will still be there. This project may be expanded at a later time to have server based persistence with authentication functionality so multiple users could login and have their task list saved for them and accessible on any browser at any time.
